# Setting up G4M3R for your Server.

**Welcome to the Setting Up Section!**

** Here**, you will learn how to set up **your bot**,** use its commands,** and **learn how to properly use it.**

To get the bot you have to go to the official G4M3R website \( [g4m3r.xyz](/g4m3r.xyz) \) and add the bot to your server. Keep in mind, you can only **add** a bot to your server when you have the **"Manage Server" permission** on the server.

To** avoid missing permissions** and with that commands that possible not function correctly, give the **bot as much permissions as possible!**

After you have completed these steps, you can **change the prefix** if you want.

* The **default prefix** for G4M3R is** .**
* If there are no other bots with the same prefix you can skip this step and jump to the next!

If you have a bot with the same prefix, it might be easier to set up a private channel for the bot so they don't interfere with each other.

3. To change the prefix type **1 into the chat **to get to the** prefix menu. **Now you can insert a new prefix into the chat. This can be _special symbols_ and/or _letters_. For example **`g!`**or **`! `**_We recommend not to use letters only as this might active that bot in normal sentences._
