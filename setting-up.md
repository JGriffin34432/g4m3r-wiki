# Setting G4M3R up for your Server

**Welcome to the Setting Up Section!**

** Here**, you will learn how to set up **your bot**, **give it commands,** and **learn how to properly use it.**

To begin, you have to go to the official G4M3R website, [g4m3r.xyz](/g4m3r.xyz), to go to the page to add the bot. This action, however, can only be completed by a member with the "Manage Server" permission.

To** avoid missing permission**s, give the **bot  much permissions as possible!**





After you have completed these steps and the bot got added, you can **change the prefix** if you want.

* the **default prefix** for G4M3R is** .**
* if there are no  other bots with the same prefix you can skip this step and jump to the next!

Just follow these simple steps to see the prefix of the bot and how to change it:

1.  Type` .settings  to get to the menu `

3. If you want to change, just type the new prefix in the chat, **if not just type Q to leave the menu.**

After the prefix change, you can add **Admins by the bot **to your server.
