# Questions & Answers

#### Q: Why wont G4M3R respond to me?

**A:** Make sure you are using the right prefix \(default is g!\). If that doesn't work, then report it in the \#support channel in the G4M3R discord server \(Use this link: [**https://discord.gg/mtJyQjW**](https://discord.gg/mtJyQjW)\)

#### Q: Something is broken on the bot and/or website, will it get fixed anytime soon?

**A:** Most likely the G4M3R development team already knows and they're doing their best to fix it. You can still let them know in the \#support channel in the G4M3R Server

#### Q: How do I change the prefix?

**A:** `[prefix]s prefix`

**Example: ** `g!s prefix .`

#### Q: How do I use the events system?

**A:** Please view the [events](/commands/community/events.md) page for a very detailed guide.

#### Q: What is the input for duration and frequency in an event?

**A:** Units

* `1 mo` = 1 month

* `1 w` = 1 week

* `1 d` = 1 day

* `1 h` = 1 hour

* `1 m` = 1 minute

**Important: **Format always has to be `<number><space><unit>`  
**Examples: **

* 2.5 h = 2 hours and 30 minutes

* 130 m = 2 hours 10 minutes

* 30 h = 1 day and 6 hours

#### Q: Is there a cheat sheet for the bot?

**A: **There is:

* .h details // lists all the commands in detail

* .e  // lists all events in the server

* _.e add &lt;event-type&gt;_ // can be **"gaming" **or **"community"** or also without event type

* _.e join &lt;eventID&gt; &lt;pinCode&gt;_ // pincode only if event is set to private \(via edit only atm\)

* _.e leave &lt;eventID&gt;_

* _.e edit &lt;eventID&gt;_ // only if you are event author or server admi

* _.e delete &lt;eventID&gt;_ // only if you are event author or server admin

* ._e pin &lt;eventID&gt;_ // only if you are event author or server admin and event is private

* in the menu** select stuff with numbers** // when numbers are shown

* _j_ or join _&lt;pinCode&gt;_ //**pincode** if event is private

* _l_ or_ leave_

* _e_ or_ edit_

* _d_ or _delete_

* _a_ or _attendees_ // gives you the** attendees view**

* _k_ or _kick_ // then type _@user_ or the _userID_ to **kick a user**

A new pin is generated when setting private to false and true again

#### **Q: How to join / leave an event?**

**A:**  Steps:

1. Type in `.events`

2. Type in the `[event ID]`_ _\(For example: `1` to select event with ID 1\)\*

3. Type in `join` \(or `leave`\)

A quicker alternative is to just type `.events join 1` or `.e j 1`

#### Q: How to edit an event while creating it?

**A:** Steps:

* Next to each category in the create event menu is a `[number]`
* **Type in the number of the category you want to edit.**
* Follow the instructions displayed.
* Press the `enter` key to save your changes.
* Type in `C` to go back.
