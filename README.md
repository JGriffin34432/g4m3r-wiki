###THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM ITOVAR18 (I cant use discord atm): I cant get the on-site links working. If you go to commands/admins, all the blue word/links work, while the ones that I made in basic are the exact same in the editor section, and they show up in blue, but they won't redirect you to the intended page. If u see this, pls reply right here. Disregard this from the wiki, I will delete this as soon as I can get this resolved. Itovar18 out.
