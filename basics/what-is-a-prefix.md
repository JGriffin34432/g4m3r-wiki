# **What is a prefix?**

The definition of a prefix is to add a word, letter, number or sign placed before another as an introduction.  
What this means for the bot, that you let the bot know that you **want to use** a command.



#### **How to know what the prefix of G4M3R is:**

The standard prefix of G4M3R is `.`  
To change the prefix, _which is advised if you have another bot that uses the same prefix_, follow the simple steps below.

1. Make sure you are in a channel where the bot has the **access and permissions** set up as described in [**Introduction**](/introduction.md)**.**
   Anyone without admin rights on the bot will not be able to get into the settings menu.

2. Access the **settings menu** of G4M3R Bot by typing `.settings`
   Here you can **view** the currently set prefix as shown below at  **\[ 1 \]  **In this case the prefix is **`.`**

3. If you want to **change** the prefix, type  `1 `into the chat.  
   This will open the **prefix layer** of the menu.

4. Now you can input any _special symbol, letter or number_ to be the **new prefix** of G4M3R on _your _server.  
   If you want to **cancel** the action enter **C** to go back to the menu. Or **Q to quit** the menu.  
  
   Keep in mind that you should choose a prefix which is:  
   **- Not in use by any bot on your server.  
   - Not commonly used to start sentences.  
   - Not used by discord itself.  
  
   **_Special symbols are usually the best option or a combination of special symbols + letters.  
   For example:  ` `**` .     *     $     !      gb!     <    >g`**_
