# **What is a prefix?**

The definition of a prefix is to add a word, letter, number or sign placed before another as an introduction.  
You put the _prefix infront of a command_, so that the bot knows you want to **use a command**.  
_For example: _**`.help`**_ will let the bot know you need help._

#### **How to know what the prefix of G4M3R is:**

The standard prefix of G4M3R is **`g!`**  
To change the prefix, _which is advised if you have another bot that uses the same prefix_, follow the simple steps below.

1. Make sure you are in a channel where the bot has the **access and permissions** set up as described in [**Setting Up**](/setting-up.md)**.**  
   Anyone without admin rights on the bot will not be able to get into the settings menu.

2. Access the **settings menu** of G4M3R Bot by typing **`.settings`**  
   Here you can **view** the currently set prefix as shown below at  **\[ 1 \]  **In this case the prefix is** `.`**![](/assets/serversettings.png)

3. If you want to **change** the prefix, type  `1`into the chat.  
   This will open the **prefix layer** of the menu.  
   ![](/assets/Serversettingsprefix.png)

4. Now you can input any _special symbol, letter or number_ to be the **new prefix** of G4M3R on \_your \_server.  
   If you want to **cancel** the action enter **C** to go back to the menu. Or **Q to quit** the menu.

   Keep in mind that you should choose a prefix which is:

   * Not commonly used to start sentences.  
   * Not used by discord itself.  
   * Not in use by any bot on your server.

   **Special symbols are usually the best option or a combination of special symbols + letters.  
   **_For example:_**  `.     *     $     !      gb!     <    >g`**
