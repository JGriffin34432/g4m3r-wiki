# Kick Command

The perfect way to kick the spam bots from your server, or unwanted people. Keep in mind that if you kick someone they can come back on the server with a server invite.

Its optional to give a reason for kicking a user. You can also add this later with the `.reason` command.  


#### Use: `[prefix]kick @user`

Extended use**:** `[prefix]kick @user [reason]`

#### Preview:

`[prefix]kick @music For testing purposes.`
