# Saverole

With the **Saverole** command you can easily save roles for your discord members to self-assign roles.  
These roles HAVE to exist on the server, so before you add one. Make sure its created on the server itself.

When you use the command **saverole** for the first time it **adds the role** to the self-assignable roles.  
If you use the command **saverole** again, it will **remove the role** from the self-assignable roles. Of course you can just add it again afterwards.

## Use: `[prefix]saverole <role-name>`

**Alias:** `[prefix]sr <role-name>`

## Preview:

`[prefix]saverole beta-news` \(1st time: Adding the role\)

`[prefix]saverole beta-news` \(2nd time: Removing the role\)
