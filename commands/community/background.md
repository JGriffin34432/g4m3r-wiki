# Background

The backgrounds command allows you to change the background of your [profile](profile.md).

### Use: `[prefix]background`

**Alias:** `[prefix]bg`

**Further use:**

`[prefix]background <category>` _\_to search all backgrounds within that category._  
Categories include: anime, fun, games, other, racing, coding, fantasy and space.  
\_Leaving the category blank lists all the backgrounds.

`[prefix]background <background number>` to immediately select the background with that ID, without previewing.
