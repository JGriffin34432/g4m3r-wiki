# G4M3R _**Administrator**_ Commands:

The admin commands provide server administrator settings.  
These settings can really make permanent changes to your server, for example the `nuke` command **PERMANENTLY** deletes messages.

But these commands also allow you to make your server a cleaner and nicer!  
For example have a welcome message for new users upon joining your server.

* [\[Delete\]](/commands/admin/delete.md)
* [\[Settings\]](/commands/admin/settings.md)
* [\[Hibye\]](/commands/admin/hibye.md)
* [\[Nuke\]](/commands/admin/nuke.md)
* [\[Permission\]](/commands/admin/permission.md)

To view all admin commands use: `[prefix]h admin`
